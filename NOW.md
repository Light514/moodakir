# NOW: Moodakir MVP - Project Initialization

**Priority**: P0
**Started**: 2024-12-25
**Branch**: master
**Blocking**: All subsequent development

## The Problem
Starting a new project from scratch for Moodakir, a modern PWA dhikr counter with no-tap mode and gamification. Need to set up the complete technical stack and documentation system before beginning feature development.

## Next Step
1. Create complete documentation system (NOW.md, STACK.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/)
2. Initialize Next.js 15 + TypeScript project
3. Configure Supabase client with user credentials

## Quick Context
- Working in: Root directory for docs, then full project setup
- Expected time: 30-45 minutes for complete initialization
- Active folder: docs/active/2024-12-25-project-initialization/

## Full Details
See: docs/active/2024-12-25-project-initialization/context.md
