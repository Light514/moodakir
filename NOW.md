# NOW: Core Counter - Tap Interface with Animations

**Priority**: P0
**Started**: 2024-12-25
**Branch**: master
**Blocking**: All other MVP features (Auth, Stats, No-tap mode)

## The Problem
Need to build the main counter component - the heart of Moodakir. Users must have a delightful, responsive tap experience with smooth animations and haptic feedback.

## Next Step
1. Create counter state hook (use-counter.ts)
2. Build counter components (display, button, main)
3. Implement Framer Motion animations
4. Add vibration feedback

## Quick Context
- Working in: app/counter/, components/counter/, lib/hooks/
- Expected time: 45-60 minutes
- Active folder: docs/active/2024-12-25-core-counter/
